So I ran `gobuster` to both the port 80 and port 8080.

In port 80 I found the `/app` directory:

which had a database (which was empty) and the `config` which had:

this `config.yml` file which was important. It contained these credentials:

(I tried to ssh into this user with the private key but it did not work)


In port 8080, in the directory `/dev` I found this page:

I created an account and I searched the page for some kind of version of this `Boltwire` until I found this:

so I searched for an exploit for this version and I found two which are included to the Exploitation part.
