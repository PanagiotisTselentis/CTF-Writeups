There was a zip file but in order to unzip it I had to have a password, which I didn't know.

So I decided to crack the password with a program called `fcrackzip`

```bash
apt install fcrackzip
```

```bash
fcrackzip -v -u -D -p /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt save.zip
```

and I found the password, so I unzipped the file:

and there were two files: a private key and a `txt` file which had the following:

```
- Figure out how to install the main website properly, the config file seems correct...
- Update development website
- Keep coding in Java because it's awesome
